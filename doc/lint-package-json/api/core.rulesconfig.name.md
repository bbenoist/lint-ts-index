Validate `name` property

```

## Remarks

Some rules: \* The name must be less than or equal to 214 characters. This includes the scope for scoped packages. \* The names of scoped packages can begin with a dot or an underscore. This is not permitted without a scope. \* New packages must not have uppercase letters in the name. \* The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line, and a folder name. Therefore, the name can't contain any non-URL-safe characters.

Some tips: \* Don't use the same name as a core Node module. \* Don't put `js` or `node` in the name. It's assumed that it's js, since you're writing a package.json file, and you can specify the engine using the "engines" field. \* The name will probably be passed as an argument to `require()`<!-- -->, so it should be something short, but also reasonably descriptive. \* You may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by that name already, before you get too attached to it. \* A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. `@myorg/mypackage`<!-- -->. See scope for more detail.
